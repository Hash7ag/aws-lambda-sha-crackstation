  title: CrackStation API
  description:
    This is a sample API of cracking unsalted[SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) and [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) (SHA-256) hashed text.
    It is able to decrypt/crack/brute-force the ciphertext which its plaintext matches `^[A-Za-z0-9?!]{1,3}$` by a pre-generated dictionary.


    [SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) is a common hashing algorithm for online servers to store sensitive authentication information.
    This project is showing how to crack or brute force unsalted hashes (passwords) easily if the password is too short.
    Hopefully, it can improve general people's cybersecurity awareness.
